# coding-challenges

Welcome to my repository, here you can find some coding challenges I resolve for practice and study.

I will be updating this repository with the challenges I solve and with relevant stuff about it.

I want to share with you some tips and considerations that might be helpful when you are solving a problem.

<ol>
    <li>Always read the full description of the problem: Even if the problem description is really verbose, it is good to read the full description. Sometimes when we see a long description we just take a look at the examples and try to figure it out what is the problem about, but if we don't read the description we can miss some very helpful information.</li>
    <li>Remember to read the constraints. Sometimes we don't read the constraints because they are at the bottom of the problem statement or just because we think we can create a general solution for the problem, but the constraints always give us valuable information about the problem, like minimum and maximum values, validations to consider and validations not to consider, etc.</li>
    <li>If you don't know what technique to use to solve the problem, take a look at the topics. Most problems are pretty descriptive about what it is required to do, but if you don't know with data structure or algorithm to use, take a look at the topics.</li>
    <li>This is a very controversial suggestion, but always give yourself some minutes to think about the problem and the solution. don't just jump at the solution tab when you feel stuck. Give time to try to find the solution. Some people think that 15 minutes is enough, others say that 1 hour and other say that as soon as you feel stuck, look at the solution, in order to keep motivated about solving a problem.</li>
</ol>
